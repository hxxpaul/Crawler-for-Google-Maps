# Crawler-for-Google-Maps

A simple but scalable web crawler for scraping data from Google Maps.
Works well on identifying and collecting desired data.
This model is designed for locating nearby pharmacies of a school, but the input value is quite flexible so it can be used to find any location.
Currently able to scrape attributes like name, address, phone number, and website. More attributes could be added, e.g., reviews and rating.
Could be reprogrammed into a function or an object-oriented class for the ease of reuse and execution.
